> [!NOTE]
> This is a community-maintained GPL-3.0 fork of [JoyHak/QuickSwitch](https://github.com/JoyHak/QuickSwitch). The fork keeps the original attribution and license while adding local fixes and documentation. See [upstream and license notes](docs/上游与许可证.md).

The current fork release is `v1.9.1`. It preserves both leading backslashes for UNC paths such as `\\server\share\QuickSwitch-main` throughout validation, Explorer URL decoding, and automatic navigation.

Imagine you want to open/save a file. A dialog box will appear and you will need to manually search for the target folder. QuickSwitch can open it instantly:
![](/Images/menu.gif)

Open any tabs in supported file managers: File Explorer, Directory Opus, Total Commander, XYplorer. All opened tabs will be available in the Menu for switching, press `Ctrl+Q` to open the Menu. [Pin and save your favorite paths](#menu-sections) and [open them later](#enforce-menu) in any file manager or application.

Enable "AutoSwitch" option to automatically change path in file dialog:

![](/Images/autoswitch.gif)

And of course you can customize the Menu:<br>

<img src="/Images/settings.gif" width=720>

Now you can install QuickSwitch or [explore](#appearance) advanced customization options!

## Installation
<a href="https://github.com/xsnowfoxcode/QuickSwitch/releases/latest">
<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/xsnowfoxcode/QuickSwitch?display_name=tag&style=flat" alt="Release"></a>
<a href="https://github.com/xsnowfoxcode/QuickSwitch/releases/latest">

<br><br>

This fork currently distributes checksum-verifiable archives through its [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xsnowfoxcode/QuickSwitch/releases). Package-manager commands for `JoyHak.QuickSwitch` install the upstream project and are intentionally not presented as fork installation commands.

### Manual installation
1. [Download](https://github.com/xsnowfoxcode/QuickSwitch/releases/latest) the latest x64 or x32 archive depending on your system architecture. If you don't know it, start with the x64 version. *It is not recommended to run the x32 version on an x64 machine!*
2. Create a directory named `QuickSwitch`, copy downloaded archive here and select "extract here" from the context menu. Follow the same steps to update the app. The `.ini` configuration will never be replaced. 
3. Run `QuickSwitch.exe`. Open some tabs in a supported file manager or create `.lnk` files in `.\Favorites`.
4. Open any application and try to open\save a file using it. E.g., open `Notepad` then `File - Open...` (or press `Ctrl+Shift+S`).
5. Press `Ctrl+Q` and look at the paths in the Menu that opens. All directories opened in supported file managers will be displayed here.
6. Explore the available options in the _"Menu settings"_ and experiment with them. Choose a convenient style and logic of the menu!

## Appearance
### Short path
Any path can shortened to a specified number of directories with limited name length. For example, enter number `2` in the `Number of dirs` field on the `ShortPath` tab. If the path to the menu will contain more than 2 directories (`C:\Windows\System32\Resources`), it will be shortened to 2 directories: `System32\Resources`

> [!NOTE]
> By default `ShortPath` cuts the beginning of the path. Option `Shorten the end` cuts the end of the path.

Enter number `3` in the `Length of dir names` field on the same tab to limit the length of each directory in the path to 3 symbols: `Sys..\Res..`. Increase this number to see their full names.

Also you can include the disk letter at the beginning or change the separator between directories to anything, e.g. tilda `~`: `W:~Windows~System32`

The first letter of the path (or selected tilda `~`) will be <ins>underlined</ins> in the menu if `Menu > Paths numbers with shortcuts` option is turned off _or_ the number of paths in the Menu is greater than 9. Press the <ins>underlined</ins> letter or symbol on your keyboard to activate this path in the menu and change file dialog path (see more about keys [here](#keyboard)).

<details><summary>Underlined letters examples</summary>

C̲:\Windows – press `C` to activate this path and change file dialog path.

W̲indows\System32 – press `W` to activate this path.

.̲.̲Windows – press `.` to activate this path.

~̲Windows – press `~` to activate this path.
 
</details>

The path shortening settings on the `ShortPath`‬ tab allows you to completely change a path structure. Experiment with this settings to change which letter will be underlined in your Menu.

#### Menu sections
In addition to the paths from the file managers, you can enable special paths on `Settings > Theme` tab.
<a name="pinned"></a>
<details><summary>Pinned paths (that are always visible)</summary> 

If you want some paths to appear permanently in the Menu, you can pin them. To do this, enable the `Settings > Theme > Show pinned paths`  option and select a key or mouse button at  `Settings > App > Pin path...`. Close the settings and open the Menu. Hold down the selected key and left click on any path. Now it is pinned and it will be stored in the configuration. You will see this path on every restart. 

If you turn this option *off*, the pinned paths will no longer be displayed. If you turn this option *on* again, all pinned paths will be displayed again. If you want to delete all pinned paths, check `Settings > Reset > Delete favorite paths` and press `Enter`.

If you want to see the duplicate paths disable the `Settings > Menu > Delete duplicate paths` option *(e.g. if you have a pinned path, but also want to quickly find it visually in the Menu by file manager icon)*.

</details>
<a name="clipboard"></a>
<details><summary>Paths from clipboard (temporary, for a single file dialog)</summary> 

You can copy any file or directory path (or any [variable](#variables)) and it will appear in the Menu. All copied paths will remain in the Menu until you open the file dialog in another application. If you want some paths to appear permanently, pin them.

<img width="616" height="683" alt="Clipboard" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0014e6fc-74df-4936-b683-9c35a2d95068" />

Copied paths will not disappear if you enforce the Menu to appear using [`Ctrl+Shift+Win+0`](#enforce-menu). It can help you to open the copied paths in multiple applications. If you copy the path to a file, QuickSwitch will use the directory with that file by removing everything after the last slash `\`.

<img width="614" height="593" alt="clipboard2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09237a63-2264-4050-9a8c-b0501536fd27" />

The option works in the background and analyzes the clipboard for the presence of a path when changing it. If several paths separated by line breaks (multi-line text) have been copied, they will be added to the Menu individually. 

Background analysis is temporarily disabled when requesting paths from other file managers *(if the `Settings > Theme > Show file managers paths` option is enabled)*, as their data is exchanged via the clipboard. If the request takes a very long time *(e.g., QuickSwitch creates the configuration for Total Commander)*, clipboard analysis will be turned off until all paths are fully received.

</details>
<details><summary>Favorite paths (with customizable icons and names)</summary>  

<a name="favorites"></a>

If you have many paths and you want to change how they are displayed in the Menu, enable the `Settings > Theme > Show favorite paths` option. This option works with `.lnk` shortcuts (links). In the input field next to it, enter the directory from which the shortcuts will be taken. You can use [variables](#variables).

Press `Enter` and open specified directory. [Create .lnk shortcut](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/create-desktop-shortcut-windows-10) to any directory or file. If the shortcut points to a file, its location will be shown in the Menu. Right click on created shortcut, select "properties" and click on the "shortcut" tab. 

<img width="1920" height="1920" alt="properties" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec65e78b-26cb-4989-a71b-a14c6ea964bf" />

You will see editable fields that will directly affect the display of the shortcut in QuickSwitch:
- Target
- Start in (working dir.)
- Comment
- Change icon (button)

The "target" field is the main path you will see. The "start in" field will only be used if the "target" field is empty. Even if the "target" points to a file, QuickSwitch will use the file directory by removing everything after the last slash `\`. You can change the displayed path and give it any name you want in the "comment" field. This field takes precedence over displaying the full or short path (`Settings > Short path`). All fields support [variables](#variables).

Let's put the `ScriptName` variable in the "comment" field. The Menu will show the internal QuickSwitch name for the shortcut named "MyFavoritePath". 

<img width="1101" height="946" alt="shell32 example" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcb9e450-efa5-40fd-899f-3f2c37842704" />

If you leave the "comment" field empty, the Menu will show the `Temp` variable value from "target" field (e.g. path to `C:\Temp`).

You can put the path to ICO, CUR, ANI, EXE, DLL, CPL, SCR and other resource that contains icons. For example I chose the system icon "shutdown" from `shell32.dll`, however I could choose ICO from the "Icons" folder. You can create as many shortcuts as you like and customize each one.

<img width="745" height="802" alt="recusrsive favorites" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a969435-cfe1-48e1-b603-edf64dde2ffe" />

If you have many shortcuts, you can give them names (e.g. "MyFavoritePath") that will not be visible in the Menu and arrange them in directories. Regardless of the directory structure of your favorite paths, QuickSwitch will display all `.lnk` files from all directories. 

<img width="1369" height="778" alt="structure" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9e2dd3c-3930-4f27-a826-e3fc86799cdc" />

You can hide some shortcuts by changing or removing their extension. If there are a lot of shortcuts and you don't need them anymore, check `Settings > Reset > Delete favorite paths`. After pressing the `Enter` button, your shortcuts will be placed in the trash. You will be able to restore them before emptying the trash can.

</details>

#### Variables
In the settings you can select the paths to the desired directories *(e.g. icons)*. You can use an absolute path *(C:\QuickSwitch\Icons)* or a path relative to the current QuickSwitch location *(Icons)* as the path. You can use variables in paths: [environment variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/usmt/usmt-recognized-environment-variables); built-in [AutoHotkey variables](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/Variables.htm#BuiltIn); declared [QuickSwitch variables](/Lib/Values.ahk). Enclose the variables in percent signs `%`.

<details><summary>Examples</summary>

```haml
Icons
%AppData%\Icons
%A_ScriptDir%\Icons
```
```rust
%SYSTEM_PATH%\%IconsDir%\SubDir
```  
```ruby
C:\%IconsDir%
```

 If you have enabled the `Settings > Theme > Show paths from clipboard`, all copied variables will also be expanded. For example, if you have [Cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder) or [ConEmu](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu) installed you can copy the `%ConEmuDir%` text to always see the path `C:\Users\...\cmder\vendor\conemu-maximus5` in the Menu. For permanent use you can pin this path and it will be visible in the menu always (enable `Settings > Theme > Show pinned paths`).
 
 <img width="616" height="683" alt="Clipboard" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80ea3b3d-9eec-4629-aa64-38b35a28ab92" />


</details>

## Keyboard
Each option and button in the settings has a corresponding key.
Take a closer look: each name has an u̲n̲d̲e̲r̲l̲i̲n̲e̲d̲ l̲e̲t̲t̲e̲r̲. Press this letter on the keyboard to jump to the option. For example:
 _C̲ancel_ – `C`; _Path s̲eparator_  – `S`.

Here is a short list of the main keys:
- Path: `0-9`.
- Auto switch: `A`
- Black list: `B`
- Settings: `S`
- Hide menu: `Esc` / `click` anywhere

You can select keys or mouse buttons on `Settings > App` tab. You can even select the `CapsLock` or `Win` key in the settings or the middle mouse button to show the Menu. While the file dialog is open, keys such as `Space`, `Win`, `CapsLock` and so on will not work as usual so that you can use them. 

## Feedback

**Feedback and bug reports:** please use the [fork issue tracker](https://github.com/xsnowfoxcode/QuickSwitch/issues/new/choose), or read the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

<a name="enforce-menu"></a>
You can enforce the Menu in any application using the keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+Win+0`. You can use this feature to change the path in any application, including supported file manager.

<details><summary>Examples</summary>

Open any file manager and press this shortcut. If you have tabs open in one file manager, you can open them in active manager using the Menu.

Another example: open Notepad++ and press this shortcut. Select any path from the Menu. Notepad++ will open all files from that path.

</details>
  
The menu will display the **paths obtained after the last opening of the file dialog** and will not change them until the next opening. The menu will be empty the first time it is opened. [Pin and save your favorite paths](#menu-sections) so you can always see them. 

## Limitations

To ensure that the correct current paths always appear in the menu:
- Disable localized folder names *(e.g. C:\Users, C:\Användare, ...).*                       
- Periodically open the file manager you need *(a big number of windows makes it difficult to find the last open manager).*
- Do not keep virtual folders open *(e.g. coll://, Desktop, Rapid Access, ...).*

QuickSwitch interacts with other applications, but the system may [restrict its access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/user-account-control-allow-uiaccess-applications-to-prompt-for-elevation-without-using-the-secure-desktop). To avoid this, run QuickSwitch as an administrator or copy it to the `C:\Program Files` (just paste `%ProgramFiles%` to the addressbar). You can also [disable UAC](https://superuser.com/a/1773044) to avoid similar problems with all applications.

<details><summary>Details</summary>

QuickSwitch is written in AutoHotkey, which uses WinAPI. It sends messages to other file managers and receives information about the current file dialog and its contents. For these actions to work correctly, it is required that **the target process is not running as an administrator** or QuickSwitch is running with UI access (if it is not a compiled `.ahk` file) or as an administrator. The reason for this is [UIPI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/user-account-control-allow-uiaccess-applications-to-prompt-for-elevation-without-using-the-secure-desktop):

> User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI) implements restrictions in the Windows subsystem that prevent lower-privilege applications from sending messages or installing hooks in higher-privilege processes. Higher-privilege applications are permitted to send messages to lower-privilege processes. UIPI doesn't interfere with or change the behavior of messages between applications at the same privilege (or integrity) level.

You can also [disable UAC](https://superuser.com/a/1773044) and use low-level or powerful antivirus _(Crowdstrike, Eset Endpoint Security)_ for full control over running applications. Modern viruses [does not require admin privileges](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/183149) to interact with the system. However, they can obtain admin rights by [exploiting Windows vulnerability](https://community.spiceworks.com/t/how-does-malware-actually-gain-admin-access-to-a-pc-without-av/329471).

## Compiling	

<a href="https://deepwiki.com/JoyHak/QuickSwitch/11.1-build-system">
<img src="https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg" alt="Build system"></a>

This app is written on  [Autohotkey language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoHotkey) and cannot be compiled. However, it can be built into a single file using a special script.

<details><summary>Dependencies</summary>

Required applications:
- `Autohotkey` interpreter (v1.1.37.02 Unicode and v2.0.19): https://www.autohotkey.com/download
- `Ahk2Exe` builder to create EXE from AHK. It's included in AHK installer: `C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\Compiler\Ahk2Exe.exe`</br>
    - Can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/AutoHotkey/Ahk2Exe </br>
    - Can be installed using the script: `C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\UX\install-Ahk2Exe.ahk`</br>
    *Directory depends on your autohotkey installation and can be found automatically. See below.*</br></br>

> Autohotkey v1.1.37.02 is an **outdated version.** If you want to start learning this language, learn `v2.0.19+`. QuickSwitch needs to be updated from `v1` to `v2`! 

Optional `7zG.exe` to create an archives with the required files: https://7-zip.org

</details>

To build the application, clone or [download this repository](https://github.com/xsnowfoxcode/QuickSwitch/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Open the [`.\Utilities\Build.ahk`](Utilities/Build.ahk) file and assign the necessary values to the variables. The fork-specific build and release procedure is documented in [维护与发布](docs/维护与发布.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The builder is designed for different AHK apps regardless of their interpreter. It will automatically select the interpreter based on the app name and its directory, so **you can use it in your AHK projects**. Unnecessary dependencies can be disabled by commenting out variables with paths to different applications.

You can change application metadata, such as version and description by changing the [Ahk2Exe directives](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/misc/Ahk2ExeDirectives.htm#Bin)  in the main file with the name like `QuickSwitch-v1.8...ahk`. After completing the configuration process, run the `Build.ahk`.
Directives allow the user to specify how app should be builded by [Ahk2Exe](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/Scripts.htm#ahk2exe). Some of the features are:
- Ability to change the version information (such as the name, description, version...).
- Ability to add resources to the compiled script.
- Ability to tweak several miscellaneous aspects of compilation.
- Ability to remove code sections from the compiled script and vice versa.

## Credits

Many people helped make QuickSwitch better! **Thank you all very much for your help and testing!** [You can become a valuable part of the project too](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The history of QuickSwitch begins with [Gepruts](https://github.com/gepruts), who laid the foundation for switching between file dialogs and supported this project [until version 0.5](https://github.com/gepruts/QuickSwitch).

After that, [DaWolfi, NotNull and Tuska](https://www.voidtools.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9881) added the first settings, color change options, and extended support for file managers.

That's how the thread appeared on the Everything forum, and the version [v0.5dw9a](https://www.voidtools.com/forum/download/file.php?id=2235) was released, which I have continued to improved.

The next version was [1.0](https://github.com/JoyHak/QuickSwitch/releases/tag/v1.0): source code was reduced and support for all XYplorer tabs was added. The function from [highend](https://www.xyplorer.com/xyfc/viewtopic.php?p=179654#p179654) helped with this.

Up until version [1.5](https://github.com/JoyHak/QuickSwitch/releases/tag/1.5), active work was underway to optimize performance and display all tabs from all file managers. I had great difficulty with Total Commander and [Dalai](https://www.ghisler.ch/board/viewtopic.php?p=470238#p470238) suggested the algorithm for obtaining all tabs from Total Commander. [Horst](https://www.ghisler.ch/board/viewtopic.php?t=76254&start=105#p471017) patiently tested the algorithm over several days of work on it. Together, we laid the foundation for the Total Commander support that is still in use today.

After the release, [Arsiendle](https://github.com/Arsiendle) sent a detailed report on the app's behavior. He helped identify minor and critical errors. His participation in testing helped to significantly improve the app.

[Noticz](https://github.com/noticz) suggested algorithms for a dark theme, switching tabs in file managers using QuickSwitch, and extending the Black List for the [big 1.8 release](https://github.com/JoyHak/QuickSwitch/releases/tag/1.8). During the testing by [eddablin](https://github.com/eddablin) some issues was fixed.

I also posted a message on the AutoHotkey discord server asking for help in fixing an ancient bug that caused the Menu to stuck on the screen, which has been known since 2007. [FuPeiJiang](https://github.com/FuPeiJiang) responded and helped resolve many issues with Menu. He helped make the main Menu stable and predictable.
